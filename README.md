# Bot Classifier
This project classifies text — in this case, Tweets — as either being from bots or from human users. The methods used were adapted from the [Reddit Bot Classifier](https://github.com/norMNfan/Reddit-Bot-Classifier/tree/master) created by Brian Norlander.

In the venv folder you can find the dataset used as well as the Python file that cleaned the data and trained and ran the classifier.
